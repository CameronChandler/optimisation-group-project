    "0. I have been setting 'demands' to be inversely proportional to the 'centre' of the city network; this is to introduce higher-demand cities in an attempt to promote crossings.\n",
    "1. Added a single 'dummy depot' from which all vehicles must leave and enter. This is to detach from 'specified/fixed depot' concept.\n",
    "2. Added extra constraints to discourage self-joins (could probably merge into another constraint)\n",
    "3. Added extra constraints to enforce that all vehicles must leave, and enter, dummy depot exactly once\n",
    "4. Switched from DFJ SEC's to MTZ SEC's; I feel it is easier to work with when it comes to allowing loops within a route, and furthermore avoids exponentially many constraints\n",
    "5. Modified MTZ SEC to 'allow' a subtour-forming join IF that node would connect directly to the dummy depot\n",
    "\n",
    "> (Refresher: MTZ SEC's) $u_i − u_j+ px_{ij} \\leq p − 1\\quad\\forall i,j \\in V$ (here $p$ = `N_STATIONS`)\n",

    "> (What I used) $u_i^{[k]} − u_j^{[k]}+ px_{ij}^{[k]} \\leq p − 1 + px_{jD}^{[k]}\\quad\\forall i,j \\in V,\\ k\\in D$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Idea: if (i -> j), if j is not the last trainstop prior to a depot, then it's just ordinary MTZ but per-route\n",

    "\n",
    "1. 'as-is' DFJ SEC in Archetti et al. didn't work, in part because you 'want' some of the kinds of subtour behaviour (customer-to-customer) that it is trying to stop.\n",
    "    - PATH 1 (implemented): Use MTZ SEC's instead\n",
    "    - PATH 2a: Allow the subtour if the subset exactly matches with a current vehicle route (quantified by `|S| == sum(x[i,j,v] for i in S for j in S) for any v in V`). Be careful to allow 'subtours' that connect to the depot, but not 'subtours' that ignore the depot.\n",
    "    - PATH 2b: Use disjunctive ideas to deactivate the |S|-1 constraint in such a situation.\n",
    "        - SOLN IDEA: the constr is `(E(S,v) <= |S| - 1 + 10e6*(E(S,v) == E(v))`\n",
    "        - OR set `f[s,v]` integer and constrain with `f[s,v] <= E[v] - E[s,v]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loops, while permissible upon a solution to (P1) are not optimal, as it is always cheaper to just form a straight route and then go back to dummy-depot.\n",
    "    - NOTE: It is easily verified that loops are now allowed by setting the cost matrix to be 100% negative, encouraging as long a path as it can have (which is `N_STATIONS+1`). Not very tractable for gurobi though\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Actual optimisation for MM goals (high station diversity, all-types-reachable). I suspect the 'demand satisfaction' idea can effectively be chucked with zero consequences. Heuristic arguments can be used to motivate these issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. My drafted algorithm is slow for 3-cluster (i.e. `N_STATIONS=12`) where the clusters were forced to connect; more constraints may hinder this. Regardless, some optimisations to the solution procedure, perhaps in the Tabu paper or hinted at in the survey, may be important for pushing forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Ignoring what I've done, there's an awful lot of 'many-paths-work' once you utilise dummy depots. Ant, nonfixed MmTSP, SDVRP, all can work. So it's a matter of choice.\n",
    "- Caveat I've noticed: Ant can be well-enough adapted to allow loops IF you set up TWO dummy depots... otherwise you have to kill (8). It's been causing problems for me\n",
    "> Apologies, but while I'm confident the SDVRP-based will not form bad subtours, I can't remember the reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If costs satisfy triangle inequality, the SDVRP optimals have one overlapping customer, max. This would allow another constraint, that each edge can only be crossed by one train max (though that violates some play strategy in MM).\n",
    "    - (but what if d >>>> Q?)\n",
    "    - I conjecture it is true for MM since d(a,b) - |b-a| is upper-bounded at ~9% of ||b-a|| and any 3 points will have a corresponding 'convex' path\n",
